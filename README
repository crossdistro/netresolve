## Core features

 * File descriptor based nonblocking host/service name resolution API
   - suitable for various file descriptor based event loops
   - unlike glibc or POSIX APIs
 * Extensible request and result APIs
   - unlike glibc or POSIX APIs
   - host/service queries (like `getaddrinfo`)
   - SRV record support for host/service queries
   - reverse queries (like `getnameinfo`)
   - DNS style queries (like `res_query` but via backends)
 * Backend-based network name resolution somewhat similar to glibc's nsswitch
   - more flexible than DNS-only libraries
   - with configurable backend options (not available in nsswitch)
   - also supports nsswitch backends (via `libnetresolve_nss.so`)
 * Avoids limitations and bugs found in glibc
   - support for `ifindex` and `scope_id` (problematic in nsswitch)
   - support for TTL information (problematic in nsswitch)
 * DNS happy eyeballs implementation
   - concurent A/AAAA requests
   - quick timeout when there's no answer to one of A/AAAA requests
 * Socket API
   - callback based wrappers over `socket()`, `bind()` and `connect()`
   - the application receives a successfully bound or connected socket
 * TCP happy eyeballs implementation
   - concurrent IPv4/IPv6 connect
   - quick timeout when there's no answer to one of IPv4/IPv6 TCP SYN packets

## Command line tool

The command line tool is useful for testing the netresolve library as well as testing various libraries supported by netresolve including glibc and libunbound.

Forward query:

    netresolve --node localhost

    netresolve --node www.sourceware.org --service http --protocol tcp

Forward query with SRV resolution:

    netresolve --srv --node jabber.org --service xmpp-client --protocol tcp

Reverse query:

    netresolve --address 192.228.79.201

    netresolve --address 2001:503:ba3e::2:30

    netresolve --port 80

    netresolve --address 192.228.79.201 --port 80

DNS style query:

    netresolve --type srv --node _xmpp-client._tcp._jabber.com

    netresolve --class ch --type txt --node version.bind

## Library API

Program or library using netresolve has to allocate a netresolve channel (or context) which is then used to perform all the queries. You may want to create multiple channels to have different configurations prepared for use.

    #include <netresolve.h>

    netresolve_t channel = netresolve_open();

Then it's possible to tweak the channel configuration to your liking.

    netresolve_set_protocol(channel, IPPROTO_TCP);
    netresolve_set_dns_srv_lookup(channel, true);

Now you choose whether you want to use blocking or nonblocking mode. Blocking mode is default, nonblocking mode requires a callback that installs and uninstalls file descriptors. In nonblocking mode, it's often useful to set another callback to pick up the results.

    static void watch_fd(netresolve_query_t query, int fd, int events, void *user_data)
    static void on_success(netresolve_query_t query, void *user_data);

    netresolve_set_fd_callbacks(channel, watch_fd, user_data);
    netresolve_set_success_callback(channel, on_success, user_data);

Now you can use the channel to perform your queries.

    netresolve_query_t query = netresolve_query(channel, "www.sourceware.org", "http");

In nonblocking mode it is useful to associate a context object with the query. Nonblocking mode guarantees that the success callback will not be run until the first `netresolve_dispatch_fd()` called after issuing the query.

    struct your_private_type context;

    netresolve_query_set_user_data(query, &context);

In blocking mode (i.e. when you didn't set the file descriptor callback), you can pick up the result immediately. In nonblocking mode, it's usually more practical to pick up the result
inside the success callback, where it's often also handy to retrieve the context object.

    struct your_private_type *context = netresolve_query_get_user_data(query); 
    size_t count = netresolve_query_get_count(query);

    for (size_t idx = 0; idx < count; idx++) {
        int family;
        const void *address;
        int ifindex;
        int socktype;
        int protocol;
        int port;
        int priority;
        int weight;
        uint32_t ttl;

        netresolve_query_get_node_info(query, idx, &family, &address, &ifindex);
        netresolve_query_get_service_info(query, idx, &family, &address, &ifindex);
        netresolve_query_get_aux_info(query, idx, &family, &address, &ifindex);

        /* do something with the data */
    }

In nonblocking mode, you can issue multiple queries and netresolve will pass back one or more file descriptors using the file descriptor callback. Your program or library needs to implement a file descriptor watch list where you add any file descriptors with events associated, or remove file descriptors when no events are specified. In order to finish the queries, you need to check those file descriptors for the requested events and pass the events back to the respective netresolve channel.

    netresolve_dispatch_fd(channel, fd, events);

When you're done with query object, you need to free it.

    netresolve_query_done(query);

The same applies to the channel object.

    netresolve_close(channel);

Examples of blocking and nonblocking use can be found in `tests/test-sync.c` and `tests/test-async.c`.

Known issues:

 * The current implementation requires additional features like epoll and timerfd and is thus limited to Linux.
 * Error reporting is currently insufficient.

Thread safety notes:

Don't share channel/query objects across threads for now.

Implementation notes:

The current implementation only registers *one* file descriptor with the application. The file descriptor is an *epoll* file descripter and the associated event is allways `POLLIN`. It's used for tracking the file descriptors that are attached to it and can be used with `select()`, `poll()` as well as `epoll()`.

### POSIX-like API

You can use a compatibility API most resembling the POSIX one but still allowing for nonblocking mode. The channel object must be created as usual and you can also tweak its configuration and set up nonblocking mode and callbacks.

    #include <netresolve-compat.h>

A special query constructor lets you use input arguments as with `getaddrinfo()`.

    struct addrinfo hints = { .ai_family = AF_UNSPEC, .ai_socktype = 0, .ai_protocol = IPPROTO_TCP, .ai_flags = 0 };
    netresolve_query_t query = netresolve_query_getaddrinfo(channel, "www.sourceware.org", "http", &hints);

A special query result getter lets you use output arguments as with `getaddrinfo()` and destroys the query object for your convenience.

    struct addrinfo *result;
    uint32_t ttl;
    int status = netresolve_query_addrinfo_done(query, &list, &ttl);

When you don't need the result object any more, free it.

    netresolve_freeaddrinfo(result);

An alternative `getaddrinfo()` implementation using netresolve in `compat/libc.c` serves as an example of how to use this compatibility API.

## GNU libc nsswitch backend

A backend for glibc nsswitch is provided as `libnss_netresolve.so` that exposes part of netresolve funcionality via the glibc name resolution API. The backend also supports a variant of `_nss_*_getaddrinfo()` API proposed by Alexandre Oliva.

## POSIX/GNU libc API replacement

If your program doesn't need the full power of the provided API but you still want to use `netresolve` as your resolver implementation, you can simply link your program to `libnetresolve-libc.so` which overrides selected libc name resolution functions.

Supported functions:

 * `getaddrinfo()`
 * `getnameinfo()`
 * `gethostbyname()`, `gethostbyname_r()`
 * `gethostbyname2()`, `gethostbyname2_r()`
 * `gethostbyaddr()`

You can use the `wrapresolve` command to start a program with `LD_PRELOAD` configured so that your program uses netresolve functions instead of libc.

    wrapresolve curl http://www.sourceware.org/

You can tweak netresolve configuration via environment variables, or you can use convenience options provided by `wrapresolve`. Currently there are options to force IPv4-only or IPv6-only resolution.

    wrapresolve -4 curl http://www.nix.cz/

    wrapresolve -6 curl http://www.nix.cz/

The netresolve package also provides a couple of testing tools for the above libc functions that can be used to test both libc and the replacement functions.

    getaddrinfo --node localhost --service http

    wrapresolve getaddrinfo --node localhost --service http

## libasyncns API replacement

The `wrapresolve` command also pulls in `libnetresolve-asyncns.so` which implements libasyncns API using netresolve.

## Socket API

Support for `socket()`, `bind()` and `connect()` is included. The only thing the application has to do is to register either `on_bind()` or `on_connect()` callback. The resolver is configured with flags suitable for the respective operation. When name resolution is finished, `on_bind()` callback is called for each successfully bound address. The `on_connect()` callback is called once, for the first successfully connected address.

## Backends

The list of backends can be chosen using `netresolve_set_backend_string()` or via the `NETRESOLVE_BACKENDS` environment variable. Backends are separated by a comma and accept options separated by a colon. A plus sign prepended to the backend name can be used to run that backend even if another backend already succeeded.

    export NETRESOLVE_BACKENDS=any,loopback,numerichost,hosts,hostname,ubdns

The command line interface also supports an option to select the backend.

    netresolve --backend any,loopback,numerichost,hosts,hostname,ubdns

The backends listed in the above comments are those used by default. You need to change the list to actually change the behavior of netresolve.

### General purpose backends

Three backends, `any`, `loopback` and `numerichost`, are available that perform trivial translations. The `hosts` backends uses `/etc/hosts` database of nodes. Nonblocking API is most useful for remote services. We have two nonblocking DNS backends, the default `ubdns` based on libunbound, and an alternative `aresdns` using *c-ares*.

### POSIX and glibc compatibility backends

You can ask `netresolve` to call `getaddrinfo()` to gather the data using the `getaddrinfo` backend. This is useful for testing the libc API as well as comparing results of general purpose netresolve backends to other implementations. This backend blocks until the `getaddrinfo()` function exits.

    netresolve --backends getaddrinfo --node www.sourceware.org

We also support glibc nsswitch modules through the `nss` backend. It finds the nsswitch dynamic module by name, loads the supported API functions and runs the most suitable one. The algorithm used in netresolve was inspired by glibc `getaddrinfo()` and glibc nscd code. This backend blocks until the nsswitch module function exits.

    netresolve --backends nss:files --node localhost

    netresolve --backends nss:dns --node www.sourceware.org

You can also pass the nsswitch module by absolute or relative path.

    netresolve --backends nss:/usr/lib64/libnss_files.so

Or you can select the specific nsswitch API to be used.

    # call `_nss_files_gethostbyname_r`
    netresolve --backends nss:files:gethostbyname --node localhost

    # call `_nss_files_gethostbyname2_r`
    netresolve --backends nss:files:gethostbyname2 --node localhost

    # call `_nss_files_gethostbyname3_r`
    netresolve --backends nss:files:gethostbyname3 --node localhost

    # call `_nss_files_gethostbyname4_r`
    netresolve --backends nss:files:gethostbyname4 --node localhost

You can use the nss plugin to test systemd-resolved via `libnss_resolve.so`.

    netresolve --backends nss:resolve --node localhost

We have experimental support for new nsswitch API based on a variant of `getaddrinfo()` proposed by Alexandre Oliva. This proposed API would consolidate the nsswitch APIs and overcome some of the limitations describe at the beginning of this document.

### Auxiliary backends

There's an experimental backend to call a script to perform name resolution
and feed it with the request serialized in a couple of text lines and read
the result from it.

    netresolve --backends exec:/path/to/my/script --node localhost


That one can be used for interactive testing as well:

    netresolve --backends exec:socat:-:/dev/tty --node www.example.com

Note: This backend is untested and maybe not even functional.

## Writing a custom backend

When a name resolution request is ready, netresolve calls one of the setup functions depending on the query type. If any of the setup functions is missing, netresolve assumes that the backend doesn't support the respective query type at all.

    setup_forward(channel, settings);

    setup_reverse(channel, settings);

    setup_dns(channel, settings);

The setup function initializes the query using input data from `netresolve_backend_get_*()` functions. It creates a state object using `netresolve_backend_new_priv()` (if necessary) to share its data with the other backend API functions. Finally it does one of the following:

1. Add any data items using `netresolve_backend_add_*()` functions and call `netresolve_backend_finished()` to signal immediate success.
2. Call `netresolve_backend_failed()` to signal immediate failure.
3. Add one or more watchers using `netresolve_backend_watch_fd()` and `netresolve_backend_watch_timeout()`.

In the third case, a dispath function is called by netresolve. It is not needed in the other two cases.

    dispatch(channel, settings);

The dispatch function retrieves the state object using `netresolve_backend_get_priv()`. Then it does one of the following:

1. Add any data items and call `netresolve_backend_finished()` to signal success.
2. Call `netresolve_backend_failed()` to signal failure.
3. Leaves one or more watchers active.

When success or failure was reported by the plugin, or when the query has been cancelled, the cleanup function is called.

    cleanup(channel, settings);

The cleanup function also retrieves the state object, removes remaining watchers using `netresolve_backend_watch_fd()` and/or `netresolve_backend_remove_timeout()`, closes open file descriptors, returns allocated memory (except the context object itself which is freed by netresolve itself).

Calls to the above functions in a single backend are serialized, calling a backend API function doesn't cause any side effects for the backend.

## Known bugs

The library doesn't currently sort paths according to their priority and/or RFC rules. The c-ares library blocks when /etc/resolv.conf is empty instead of quitting immediately, which in turn breaks tests when offline. The DNS backend doesn't support search domains. For more information, see the `TODO` file.

## Related projects

### glibc

One way to look at netresolve is to see it as a testbed for future glibc improvements. It's written with testing and debugging in mind and prototyping new ideas in netresolve is very easy. Another way is to see it as a more flexible alternative to glibc host and service name resolution functionality. Either way glibc and POSIX were the main inspirations for this project.

### c-ares

They provide `ares_fds()` and `ares_timeout()` to update the current set of file descriptors and the associated timeout. The `netresolve` callback API improves greatly on that. The application submits the `watch_fd()` callback.

### sssd

They provide a backend-based caching service for user/group name resolution, authentication and related stuff. As netresolve doesn't really need to cache its results nor does it need to perform authentication services, it provides just a shared library, not a long-running daemon. Also, for DNS resolution they currently use `c-ares`.

### libevent, squid, etc...

According to the website, libevent is using internal asynchronous DNS as well. The same applies to squid. Apparently the operating system's resolution API is not sufficient for many tools.

### systemd-resolved

To my knowledge, name resolution related systemd features were announced after I published netresolve. The relation to that project is yet to be seen.
